## Front-end framework

This is a front-end framework example just using touches of jQuery (AJAX and Events) and the DOM API (for adding/removing elements to the page).

It intends to use Object.observe to handle changes to the underlying model and then re-render the page. Since Object.observe is Harmony (ECMAS 7) it can only be used in Chrome right now (thanks for supporting the future Google!)
